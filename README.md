# Monkey Programming Language Interpreter

Welcome to the Monkey programming language interpreter project! Monkey is a small, dynamically typed programming language designed for simplicity and learning. This interpreter is written in Python and allows you to execute Monkey programming language scripts and interact with the language through a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL).

## Features

- **Variables**: Support for binding values to names.
- **Data Types**: Includes integers, booleans, strings, arrays, and hash maps.
- **Functions**: First-class and higher-order functions with closures.
- **Control Structures**: Conditionals (`if` statements) and return statements for controlling flow.
- **Built-in Functions**: A small set of built-in functions for common operations.
- **REPL**: An interactive shell to execute Monkey language expressions and statements.
